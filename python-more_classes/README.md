- [Object-Oriented Programming](https://alu-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/PgSxX0FFvkpyAjNyoU0qcg) (Please be careful: in most of the following paragraphs, the author shows the way you should not use or write a class, in order to help you better understand some concepts and how everything works in Python 3. Make sure you read only the following paragraphs: “General Introduction,” “First-class Everything,” “A Minimal Class in Python,” “Attributes,” “Methods,” “The `__init__` Method,” “Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding,” “`__str__`- and `__repr__`-Methods,” “Public- Protected- and Private Attributes,” & “Destructor”)
