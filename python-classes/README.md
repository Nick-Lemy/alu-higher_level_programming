# Python - Classes and Objects

## Background Context
OOP is a totally new concept for all of you (especially those who think they know about it :)). It’s VERY important that you read at least all the material that is listed below (and skip what we recommend you to skip, you will see them later in the curriculum).

As usual, make sure you type (never copy and paste), test, understand all examples shown in the following links (including those in the video), test again etc. The biggest and most important takeaway of this project is: experiment by yourself OOP, play with it!s

#### Read or watch:

- [Object Oriented Programming](https://alu-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/5envVBirO286MdSZgZ4DoQ) (Read everything until the paragraph “Inheritance” excluded. You do NOT have to learn about class attributes, `classmethod` and `staticmethod` yet)
- [Object-Oriented Programming](https://alu-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/sCdUrEsHLFH2NpUzI5Xx8w) (Please *be careful*: in most of the following paragraphs, the author shows things the way you should not use or write a class in order to help you better understand some concepts and how everything works in Python 3. Make sure you read everything in the following paragraphs: General Introduction, First-class Everything, A Minimal Class in Python, Attributes (You DON’T have to learn about class attributes), Methods, The `__init__` Method, “Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding,” “Public, Protected, and Private Attributes”)
